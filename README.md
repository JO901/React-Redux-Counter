Summary 

A simple react + redux project to increment a counter button. this is for those who need a non-complicated view of the process of 
state management of redux with comments(that I don't know how useful they will be).

if there are any errors(coding or not) please inform me and I will update it. 

Instructions 

1. Make sure you are inside the vite-project folder before you start 'cd vite-project'.

2. Note Use 'npm run dev' instead of 'npm start' in the terminal to open up the server.
    IMPORTANT: 'npm run dev' will not work if your current location in the terminal is not 'vite-project'

3. Ignore all files except for those in the 'src' folder and the 'index.html' file.

Extra

1. Make sure to have 'Redux DevTools' and 'React Developer Tools" installed to your chrome browser to moniter changes to the store.

2. Pay attention to what is being imported at the top of each file.
